## Development Process

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-new-filter-option`
- `fix/pdf-upload-bug`
- `docs/update-api-documentation`
- `refactor/optimize-rag-pipeline`

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(rag): add semantic chunking for better context retrieval
fix(auth): resolve Google sign-in timeout issue
docs(api): update Gemini API documentation
refactor(ui): optimize component rendering performance
```

### Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(component): add new feature"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use the PR template
   - Provide clear description
   - Link related issues
   - Request reviews from maintainers

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer `useCallback` and `useMemo` for performance
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop types and interfaces

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Ensure responsive design
- Maintain accessibility standards

### File Organization

```
components/
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/           # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ blocks/       # Complex UI blocks
â”œâ”€â”€ icons/        # Icon components
â””â”€â”€ [feature]/    # Feature-specific components

services/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/          # API service functions
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/        # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ types/        # Type definitions
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Write unit tests for:
- Utility functions
- Service functions
- Component logic
- Custom hooks

```typescript
// Example test
describe('RAGPipeline', () => {
  it('should process PDF text correctly', async () => {
    const pipeline = new RAGPipeline();
    const result = await pipeline.processPDF('test content');
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

Test complete user flows:
- PDF upload and processing
- Flashcard generation
- User authentication
- Data persistence

### E2E Tests

Test critical user journeys:
- Complete study session
- User registration and login
- Subscription upgrade flow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
